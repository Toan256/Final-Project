## 5.	Research object
This research examines the factors affecting Vietnamese laborâ€™s salary

## 6.	Scientific contribution
Scientifically, research has contributed three fundamental meanings.
(1) This study confirmed the elements that have effects on Vietnamese income
(2) This was one of the most recent studies on Vietnamese Salary.
(3) This study can be used as a starting point for further research.

## 7.	Technologies
The research begins with data cleaning, which is performed using Google Sheets to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset. After cleaning, the data is analyzed using correlation analysis and linear regression. The correlation analysis helps identify relationships between the independent variables (such as age, gender, education level, years of experience, job level, and job field) and the dependent variable (salary). Linear regression is then conducted using Python's Pandas library to quantify these relationships and develop a predictive model for salary.
