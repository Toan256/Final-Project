## 5.	Research object
This research examines the factors affecting Vietnamese laborâ€™s salary

## 6.	Scientific contribution
Scientifically, research has contributed three fundamental meanings.

(1) This study confirmed the elements that have effects on Vietnamese income

(2) This was one of the most recent studies on Vietnamese Salary.

(3) This study can be used as a starting point for further research.

## 7.	Technologies
The research begins with data cleaning, which is performed using Google Sheets to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset. After cleaning, the data is analyzed using correlation analysis and linear regression. The correlation analysis helps identify relationships between the independent variables (such as age, gender, education level, years of experience, job level, and job field) and the dependent variable (salary). Linear regression is then conducted using Python's Pandas library to quantify these relationships and develop a predictive model for salary.

## 8.	Key insights
**Age**: Our analysis reveals that as individuals age, their salary tends to decrease slightly after a certain point, which may reflect a market preference for younger employees in certain industries or roles.

**Gender**: The data indicates a gender wage gap, with males earning significantly more than females on average, highlighting ongoing disparities in the workplace.

**Education** Level: Higher education levels are strongly correlated with higher salaries, underscoring the importance of educational attainment in career advancement.

**Years of Experience**: Experience is a critical determinant of salary, with each additional year of experience leading to a substantial increase in earnings.

**Job Level**: Promotions and higher job levels contribute positively to salary, emphasizing the value of career progression.

**Job Field**: Certain job fields are associated with lower salaries, which may reflect differences in industry standards or demand for specific skills.

## 9.	Hypotheses based on insights
**1. Age and Salary**: There is a negative relationship between age and salary after a certain age, indicating that salaries tend to decrease as employees get older beyond a specific age threshold.

**2. Gender and Salary**: Males, on average, earn a higher salary than females, reflecting a gender wage gap in the dataset.

**3. Education Level and Salary**: Higher education levels are positively correlated with higher salaries, meaning individuals with more advanced degrees tend to earn more.

**4. Years of Experience and Salary**: There is a positive relationship between years of experience and salary, where each additional year of experience leads to an increase in earnings.

**5. Job Level and Salary**: Higher job levels are associated with higher salaries, suggesting that promotions and advancement in job hierarchy result in increased earnings.

**6. Job Field and Salary**: Certain job fields are associated with lower salaries, implying that the industry or sector in which an individual works significantly impacts their earning potential.

**7. Interaction Between Variables**: The effect of education level on salary is moderated by years of experience, meaning that the salary increase associated with higher education is more pronounced for individuals with more experience.

## 10.	Recommendations based on analysis results
**Pursue Higher Education:** Investing in further education can significantly boost earning potential, as higher education levels are strongly linked to higher salaries.

**Gain More Experience:** Accumulating years of relevant experience is crucial for increasing salary, making continuous skill development and career longevity important.

**Seek Promotions:** Actively pursuing higher job levels and responsibilities can lead to higher salaries, emphasizing the importance of career growth and advancement.

**Choose High-Demand Fields:** Selecting or transitioning to fields with higher salary potential can also be a strategic move for individuals looking to improve their earnings.
